  ## Installation
  Fork or clone the GitHub Repo and/or download the files containing the code. Open the code in your favorite code editor.

  ## Usage
  With the code open, run 'node index' in the terminal or command line and answer the prompts. You may need to be in the correct directory for node to run correctly. Finally, push your work to GitHub and your README is complete! Any changes needed to be made can be made once the README is created. Proof read your README to ensure it is the way you want it.

  ## How to Contribute
  Next steps: 
    1. Create options for a video demonstration or photo/screenshot of your project
    2. Allow for omition of sections the user does not want
    3. Allow user to create their own sections.

  ## Tests
  You will need to have the generator open in your terminal or command line. You may also need to be in the same directory as index.js. Run 'node indes.js' in the terminal and you can test all of the prompts. As of now, none of the prompts are allowed to be skipped. Each time you test the code a new .md file will be created. Feel free to delete any unwanted .md files.
